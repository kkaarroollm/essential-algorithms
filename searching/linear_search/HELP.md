### Linear search - Iterate through collection one element at a time

---
**Runtime complexity:**
- O(n) - Linear time complexity

**Memory complexity:**
- O(1) - Constant space complexity

**Disadvantages:**
- Slow for large collections

**Advantages:**
- Simple to implement
- Works on unsorted collections
- Works on collections that do not support random access

**Related examples:**
